This module contains a series of important utilities that determine derived weather values from physical weather
measurements. In addition to calculations for wet bulb temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill,
THW/THSW indexes, heating and cooling degree days, and high 10-minute wind average, it also includes conversion
functions for various units of temperature, barometric pressure, and wind speed.

It is important that all of the math in this module takes place using decimal precision. Floating-point precision is
far too inaccurate and can cause errors of greater than plus/minus one degree in the results. As such, the first
~100 lines of the code contain dozens of constants used in the aforementioned calculations. These constants come from
documents published by NOAA / the National Weather Service of the United States of America, Davis Instruments,
the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and public domain imperial/SI conversion algorithms. Where possible/applicable,
the source of algorithms and the constants they use are cited within the algorithm (not with the constants).

Note that naming conventions for constants and variables in this module are non-standard, and in some cases violate
PEP8. This is intentional. Where a constant is defined in an official algorithm as a letter with a subscript number,
it is defined in this module as the abbreviation of the purpose, followed by an underscore, followed by the constant
name in the official algorithm. For example, the major heat index algorithm defines constants c1, c2, c3, ... c9. They
are defined in this module as `HI_C1`, `HI_C2`, `HI_C3`, ... `HI_C9`. Where a constant is used as a literal within
an algorithm, it is defined in this module as the abbreviation of the purpose, followed by an underscore, followed by
the numbers before the decimal point, optionally followed by an underscored and the numbers after the decimal point.
These shorter names help the code-defined constants more closely match the names used in the algorithms and also keeps
the code short and readable for the long and complex algorithms used in this module.

Some common constants used by multiple algorithms are defined at the top of the module as the English spelling of the
numeric value. A handful of other simpler constants are defined with standard, useful names.

In some of the functions, the local variables are defined as one- or two-letter uppercase variables, in violation of
PEP8. This is done so that the variables match those variables used in the official algorithms, in order to make the
code more readable.

	they are used together to determine how to weight each record against other records. Minutes covered must be a
	whole number if it is 1 or more, but it may be less than 1 for rapid sample rates (for example, a 2.5-second sample
	rate would yield a minutes-covered value of 0.04166666666667).

	This returns a tuple of (10mwaS, 10mwaD, 10mwaTs, 10mwaTe), where:
		- 10mwaS is the highest 10-minute wind average speed in the same unit as was input
		- 10mwaD is the statistical mode of all the recorded wind directions during the high 10-minute wind average
			period
		- 10mwaTs is start time of the high 10-minute wind average period: in more technical terms, it is the result
			of the following:
			- If the number of minutes covered is 1, it is the value of the timestamp from the first record in the high
				10-minute wind average period
			- If the number of minutes covered is greater than 1, it is 1 less than minutes covered subtracted from
				the value of the timestamp from the first record in the high 10-minute wind average period
		- 10mwaTe is the end time of the high 10-minute wind average period

	The logic behind the start timestamp seems complex, but it's the result of the fact that a single record can
	represent multiple minutes of wind samples, and the provided timestamp only represents the end of the sampling
	period. So, if the number of minutes covered is 10, the timestamp is the end of the 10th minute. The values
	returned, therefore, end up being the timestamp for the end of the 1st minute (the start) and the timestamp for
	the end of the 10th minute (the end). If the number of minutes covered is 1, the timestamp is the end of just that
	minute, but 10 records make up the 10-minute period. So the values returned are the timestamp for the end of the
	1st 1-minute period record (the start) and the timestamp for the end of the 10th 1-minute period record (the end).
	In both cases, all the caller must do to determine the true start time (as opposed to the end timestamp for
	the start minute) is to subtract 1 minute from it.
