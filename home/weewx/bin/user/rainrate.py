weewx-rainrate is a WeeWX service that attempts to produce a
"better" rainRate in loop packets.

Estimating Rain Rates from Tipping-Bucket Rain Gauge Measurements
-----------------------------------------------------------------
See: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20070016690/downloads/20070016690.pdf
One-minute rain rates suffer substantial errors, especially at low rain rates.
When one-minute rain rates are averaged to 4 -7 minute scales, the errors
dramatically reduce. At the 10- and 15-minute time scales, the errors further
reduce. If the time scale increases to longer than 30 minutes, the errors become
negligible.

The impetus for this extension is that author purchased a
high quality HyQuest Solutions TB3 siphoning rain gauge.
It is accurate to 2% at any rain intensity, but with the
siphon, two tips can come in quick succession.  As such
the rainRate produced by measuring the time delta between
two tips can be wildly overstated.

weewx-rainrate ignores the rainRate in the loop packet (if present)
by overwriting/inserting rainRate to be the max of the
4 through 15m rain rate as computed by the extension.

For low rain cases:

If there was just one bucket tip (in the first 60s), we would see a rate of 0.6
per hour selected (which is absurdly high).  For cases where 0.01 is observed in the
last 15m, no matter when in that 15m it occurred, only the 15m bucket is considered
(rate of 0.04).

Similarly, for cases where only 0.02 has been observed in the last 15m, the
1-9m buckets will report unreasonably high rates, so they will not be
considered.

Lasttly, for cases where 0.03 has been observed in the last 15m, the 1m-4m
buckets will not be considered.
