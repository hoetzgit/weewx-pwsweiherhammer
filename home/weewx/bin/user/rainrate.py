weewx-rainrate is a WeeWX service that attempts to produce a
"better" rainRate in loop packets (and archive records) for
siphon tipping bucket rain gauges.

This extension will be useful for tipping
rain gauges that use a siphon for better accuracy over a wide
range of rainfall.  These industrial gauges maintain their
accuracy over a wide range of rain intensity, but are
unsuitable for computing rain rate via the time
between two tips.  The reason for the unsuitability is that
a single discharge of the siphon may result in multiple tips
(in close sucession).  The result of two tips in close
succession will be a wildly overstated rain rate.

The impetus for this extension was the author's purchase of a
HyQuest Solutions TB3 tipping rain gauge with siphon.  It is
accurate to 2% at any rain intensity, but with the siphon, two
tips can come in quick succession.

The extension was tested with a HyQuest Solutions TB3 siphon
tipping bucket rain gauge and using a HyQuest Solutions TB7 (non-siphon)
tipping bucket rain gauge as a reference (for rain rate).
