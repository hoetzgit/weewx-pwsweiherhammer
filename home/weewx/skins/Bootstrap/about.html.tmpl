            <h2>How it's done</h2>
            <p>This website summarizes weather data logged by a weather station using the polished and highly
                customisable
                <A href="http://weewx.com">WeeWX</a> software (version $station.version). WeeWX collects data from the
                weatherstation in a customizable interval and stores it in an archive database.
                It also creates all the data for the graphs and webpages which are uploaded to the website every interval.
            </p>

            <p>This website uses a custom skin which uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to deal with
                the layout and presentation. The gauges and the history tables are generated by JavaScript using
                <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html">Apache eCharts</a> and by Python scripts
                which hook into WeeWX.</p>

            <p>Optionally, using MQTT, the gauges and charts can be updated as the weatherstation sends a "loop" value.</p>

            <p>The code for this skin can be found on github:
                <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer">github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer</a>
            </p>

            <p>Having already a working WeeWX installation, the easiest way to install this skin is to download the
                source archive from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases">releases</a>,
                and use the WeeWX installer to unpack it:</p>
            <pre>wee_extension --install [wherever you've put the archive]</pre>

            <p>Set the page title and footer through the corresponding file for your language in
                <code>skins/Bootstrap/lang/{your_language}.conf</code>. Change the template language using
                lang = {your_language} in the section for your skin in <code>weewx.conf</code>
