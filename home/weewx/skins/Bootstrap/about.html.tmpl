            <h2>How it's done</h2>
            <p>This website summarizes weather data logged by a weather station using the polished and highly
                customizable
                <A href="http://weewx.com">WeeWX</a> software (version $station.version). WeeWX collects data from the
                weatherstation in a customizable interval and stores it in an archive database.
                It also creates all the data for the graphs and webpages which are uploaded to the website every interval.
            </p>

            <p>This website uses a custom skin which uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to deal with
                the layout and presentation. The gauges and the history tables are generated by JavaScript using
                <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html">Apache eCharts</a> and by Python scripts
                which hook into WeeWX.</p>

            <p>Optionally, using MQTT, the gauges and charts can be updated as the weatherstation sends a "loop" value.</p>

            <p>The code for this skin can be found on github:
                <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer">github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer</a>
            </p>

            <p>Having already a working WeeWX installation, the easiest way to install this skin is to download the
                source archive from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases">releases</a>,
                and use the WeeWX installer to unpack it:</p>
            
            <pre>wee_extension --install [wherever you've put the archive]</pre>
            
            <p>or, if you are running weewx v5 and above:</p>
            
            <pre>weectl extension install https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/archive/refs/tags/{replace_with_the_current_version.}zip</pre>

            <p>The preferred way to custumize your page is to apply any changes and additions in your weewx.conf, using the skin's section within <code>[StdConfig]</code>.
                Change the language using <code>lang = {your_language}</code> in the section for your skin in <code>weewx.conf</code>.
                For more information concerning localization see the official <a href="http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#localization">WeeWX docs</a>.

            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>The following example is an excerpt of weewx.conf. It will result in a english translated page, using the en_US locale, kilometers per hour instead of miles per hour for group_speed and setting the Footer text to "My custom footer text". Also, two news items will be shown on the "News" page. Also, a custom chart "inTemp", appearing as first chart, and the preconfigured "radiation" chart, as the last chart, is configured.</p>

            <p>Let's say, you want to exchange this about page with your own. Create a template file <code>extra.html.tmpl</code>
             and tell CheetahGenerator to handle it. Then exchange <code>about</code> with <code>extra</code> in the <code>navigation_items</code>. 
             Then configure your new page in the <code>[[[[extra]]]]</code> stanza as below.</p>
