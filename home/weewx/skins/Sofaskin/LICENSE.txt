# The main goal was to build a beautiful and modern     #
# layout inspired by Google's material design.          #
# It is fully responsive and looks great on all         #
# kind of devices.                                      #
#                                                       #
# Successfully tested on weewx 3.0 / 3.0.1.             #
# Almanac Python extension recommended.                 #
# Feel free to change the layout however you want.      #
# Under css/scss you'll find all the Sass-files to      #
# change colors etc. Or change them in the main.css.    #
